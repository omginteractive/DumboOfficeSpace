# Shortcodes

## Guidelines

1. One short code per file
2. File name and short code name should match
3. Related shortcodes can be grouped under their own folder within shortcodes

- Ex: shortcodes > time > get-year.php, get-day.php, get-hour.php

## Enqueuing

Files in this folder will automatically be enqueued.
