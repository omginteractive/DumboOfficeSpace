# Custom Block Panels

## Usage

These files are used to add custom functionality to core wordpress blocks. Do not alter.

### Note to self

This readme will need to be expanded slightly, maybe with links to documentation. The complexities of extending core blocks is beyond the scope of a simple readme file.
